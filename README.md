The application is a training tool for beginner football players. It contains a collection of football tricks with step-by-step instructions for their implementation, as well as videos with the ability to watch them in slow motion. Works offline.

The application was developed for the Android platform with JavaScript/HTML/CSS using the Cordova framework, and can be quickly ported to IOS and other platforms supported by the framework.

## Release

## Publication

It was decided to publish two versions of the application on the Google Play site: a paid full version, and a free lite version with a limit on the number of tricks. The use of advertising in the application is inappropriate, as it involves working offline.

_The results of the publication of a free demo version for the period from 2017 to 2021:_

## Conclusions

The main reasons for the unprofitability of the application are the insolvency of the target audience, the lack of replenishment of the collection of feints.

The fragile youthful mind failed to conquer the market, perhaps because there was practically no market itself, but certain skills and experience were acquired during the development, publication and promotion of a mobile application, so everything was not in vain.
